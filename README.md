### 1. **Different Types of Similarity Search and Their Metrics**  
- **Keyword Search**:  
  Matches queries and data based on exact keywords or phrases.  
  - **Metric**: String matching or frequency-based metrics like Jaccard similarity or TF-IDF.  
  - **Limitation**: Doesn't account for the semantic meaning of words.

- **Semantic Search**:  
  Matches based on the meaning of the query rather than exact words.  
  - **Metric**: Cosine similarity is commonly used to compare vector embeddings generated by models like Sentence Transformers.  

- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**:  
  Speeds up similarity search by approximating the nearest matches in vector space.  
  - **Metric**: Distance-based metrics like Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance in vector embeddings.

### 2. **Solution to Mitigate Slowness of Nearest Neighbor Similarity Calculation**  
- Use **ANN algorithms** such as FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) or HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to optimize large-scale searches.
- Pre-compute and store embeddings for the dataset to avoid redundant calculations during runtime.
- Use **vector clustering** to partition the dataset into smaller, more manageable groups.

---

### 3. **Fixing Issues and Improving Similarity-Based Search**  
- **Combine Methods**: Use a hybrid approach by combining keyword search with semantic search for enhanced precision.
- **Domain-Specific Models**: Use pre-trained models fine-tuned for the dataset's domain to generate more accurate embeddings.
- **Improve Data Quality**: Remove duplicate or irrelevant data and cluster similar entries to reduce ambiguity.
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Use distributed systems or vector databases like Milvus to handle large datasets efficiently.  
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate user feedback to refine search results over time.

These solutions make similarity search systems faster, more accurate, and better suited for large-scale applications.


# Semantic Search FAQ Project

This project implements a simple **semantic search system** for an FAQ dataset using Python and Sentence Transformers. It demonstrates how to retrieve the most relevant answer for a user query based on semantic similarity.

---

## üìñ Features
- Uses **semantic embeddings** to understand the meaning of questions.
- Retrieves the most relevant FAQ answer for a given query.
- Implements **cosine similarity** for comparing query and FAQ embeddings.
- Works on small datasets but provides a foundation for scaling to larger ones.

---

## üîß Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`

---

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Load the Dataset**: The FAQ dataset is stored in `faq.csv`, with sample questions and answers.
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Each question is converted into a numerical embedding using a pre-trained model.
3. **Compare Similarities**: For a user query, cosine similarity is used to find the FAQ with the closest meaning.
4. **Return the Answer**: The answer corresponding to the most similar question is displayed.

## üìÅ Dataset
The FAQ dataset (`faq.csv`) contains example questions and answers:
| Question                           | Answer                                                                 |
